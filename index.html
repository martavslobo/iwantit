  <!-- "Question 1" -->
  <h1>Why do I want to study at Shillington?
  </h1>
  <h2><p>It's a creative hub like no other. I am so impressed with all the graduates' work and I'd love to be able to say that I too trained there.</p>
  <p>I can't wait to get my hand on all the software, all the experiementation, making things, creating things, responsing to briefs and finally build my portfolio.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But it's not just the 'what' is the 'how'.</p>
   <p>I'm in my 30's and retraining at this age means that you need to factor in boring things like not having an income during a period of time, or taking a paycut that I may not recover for a number of years</p>
   <p>Being able to kick-starting my careeer though and knowing what I'll be able to achieve is what really attracts me to it.</p>
  </h2>

  <!-- "Question 2" -->
  <h1>What does creativity mean to you?
  </h1>
  <h2>I didn't know until recently. Or I knew but hadn't fully realised. It actually is who I am. It's not just I strive on is what defines me a person. And that's why I realised that I can't spend the rest of my life doing any odd job. It needs to be channeled into the right one: the one of graphic design.<h2>

  <!-- "Question 2" -->
  <h1>What do you want to get out of your Shillington experience?
  </h1>
  <h2>I want to go from being a creative person to becoming a graphic designer; to build a portfolio and be able to show a body of work that speaks for itself; to come out at the other end with a new profession that suits who I am.<h2>
