  <div id="#Shillington" class="tabcontent" style="display: block;">
    <h2>Why Shillington?</h2>
    <p>Because this place is a creative hub like no other. I am so impressed with all the graduates' work and I'd love to be able to say that I too trained there. I can't wait to get my hands on all the software, all the experimentation, making things, creating things, responding to briefs and finally build my portfolio.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>But it's not just the 'what' is the 'how'.</strong> I'm in my 30's and retraining at this age means that you need to factor in multiple things. Being able to kick-start my careeer and knowing what I'll be able to achieve is really something to aspire to.</p>
    <p></p>
  </div>

  <div id="#Creativity" class="tabcontent" style="display: block;">
    <h2>What does creativity mean to me?</h2>
    <p>I didn't know until recently. Or I knew but hadn't fully realised. It actually is who I am. It's not just what I thrive on, is what defines me a person. And that's why I realised that I can't spend the rest of my life doing any odd job. It needs to be channeled into the right one: the one of graphic design.</p>
    <p></p>
  </div>

  <div id="#Outcomes" class="tabcontent" style="display: block;">
    <h2>What do I hope to achieve?</h2>
    <p>I want to go from being a creative person to becoming a graphic designer; to build a portfolio and be able to show a body of work that speaks for itself; to come out at the other end with a new profession that suits who I am.</p>
    <p></p>
